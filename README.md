Samples for utilizing multi-stage docker build feature for different language run-times

Here, we have covered C, Go and Java examples. We can consider using other language runtimes as well such as nodejs and python.

While working with python consider using https://pythonwheels.com/ . 

For Nodejs consider separating out node_module installation separately for dev and production.
